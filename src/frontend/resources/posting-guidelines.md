# Posting Guidelines

Please follow our posting guidelines so that we can help you.

### 1. Choose a proper Title

A good title will encourage more people to see your question.\
Posts with a title like "help pls" will most likely be ignored by most of the community. Use a title that describes your problem as well as possible. A good example of that is the title "How can I destroy an object?".

### 2. Describe your problem

Now that you have a good title, start describing your problem in detail. Provide some background information if possible.

### 3. Add Code

Add code to your post if applicable. Let us know what you've already tried in your code to help the community understand your problem.\
Paste the code with Discord formatting.

### Example:

````markdown
```cpp
#include 
int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}  
```
````

### 4. Add useful information

Add useful information, such as the expected and current output, if applicable. You should also consider adding your operating system, your IDE, your compiler and other useful information to the post.

### 5. Add Tags

Add tags to your post. This will help more people find your post.
